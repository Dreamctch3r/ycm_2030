#The YCM Manifesto

The Youth Consciousness Movement adopts its name and its values from Steve Biko’s Black Consciousness Movement. It is a movement not confined to one race or generation, rather to one problem. That problem is *Apathy*, a crippling societal sickness which should not be tolerated. It is a movement with a hunger to engage society. It is a movement to renew the identity and purpose of a nation. It is a movement to drive change by inspiring action.

YCM  provides a framework to help individuals along their journey of self-development, as only a society resolute in its individual and shared identity is capable of effecting change.

YCM is a platform that exposes individuals (in particular the youth) to the plethora of social issues that plague our continent in the hope that a community of active citizens will be unleashed, ready and hungry to leave their mark, to shape society. The hope is that YCM may become a “Citizen Broker” for social initiatives.

YCM is a community of Thought Leadership Catalysts (*TLC*’s) who spread the message that every positive action sends a ripple of hope through society.

*Mission*: Change the social fabric of an entire nation. Beginning with the Individual. Overflowing into the collective.

*Vision 2030*: That of a society resolute and purposeful in its embrace of diversity and its potential for shared greatness, where abject poverty and inequality have no place in our streets.
